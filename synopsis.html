    <h1>Synopsis</h1>

    <p>After total humiliation at her thirteenth birthday party, Jenna Rink wants to just hide until she's thirty. 
        Thanks to some magic wishing dust, Jenna's prayer has been answered. 
        With a knockout body, a dream apartment, a fabulous wardrobe, an athlete boyfriend, a dream job, and superstar friends, this can't be a better life. 
        Unfortunately, Jenna realizes that this is not what she wanted. The only one that she needs is her childhood best friend, Matt, a boy that she thought destroyed her party. 
        But when she finds him, he's a grown up, and not the same person that she knew.</p>
